# ToDo7

ToDo7 is the incredibly simple "to do" webapp with simple tasks management. ToDo7 demonstrates that you can create fully functioning iOS app with minimal efforts in a few hours. Using PhoneGap you can convert it to native iOS app.

### ToDo7 Features

* Local Storage. All your "to do" tasks are stored in Local Storage, so you don't need to add them each time you launch app.
* Manifest Cache. Due to Manifest Cache you can still access app without internet connection.
* Full Screen. ToDo7 is also a full screen app (on iOS).
